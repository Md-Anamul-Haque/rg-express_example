Here's your project's README.md file, incorporating the use of rg-express:

# APIs

This project provides several APIs using the `rg-express` library. Below is a summary of each API endpoint:

- `/`: Root endpoint of the application.
- `/hello`: Endpoint to greet the user.

- `/hello/*`: Endpoint to greet the user with variable slugs in the URL.

- `/product/:id`: Endpoint to fetch product data based on the provided ID.

## Project Structure

### Routes Directory

```bash
├── package.json
├── src
├── routes
      ├── product
      │      ├── route.ts
      │      └── [slug]/route.ts
      ├── hello
      │      └── [...slugs]
      │      └── route.ts
      └── ...

```

You can easily understand the structure and functionality of each endpoint by examining the files in the `/src/routes` directory.
