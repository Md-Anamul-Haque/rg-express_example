Here's your project's README.md file, incorporating the use of rg-express:

# APIs

This project provides several APIs using the `rg-express` library. Below is a summary of each API endpoint:

- `/`: Root endpoint of the application.
  
- `/hello`: Endpoint to greet the user.

- `/hello/*`: Endpoint to greet the user with variable slugs in the URL.

- `/product/:id`: Endpoint to fetch product data based on the provided ID.

## Project Structure

### Routes Directory

```bash
├── package.json
└── src
└── routes
├── product
│ ├── route.ts // Handles '/product'
│ └── [slug]/route.ts // Handles '/product/:slug'
├── hello
│ └── [...slugs]
│ └── route.ts // Handles '/hello/:*'

```

You can easily understand the structure and functionality of each endpoint by examining the files in the `/src/routes` directory.
